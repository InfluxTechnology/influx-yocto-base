# influx-yocto-base

HOW TO USE

Install the repo tool

The repo tool has been developed to make it easier to manage multiple Git repositories. Instead of downloading each repository separately the repo tool can download all with one instruction. Download and install the tool by following the>

    Create a directory for the tool. The example below creates a directory named bin in your home folder.

mkdir ~/bin

    Download the tool

curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repodownloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

    Make the tool executable

chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

    Add the directory to the PATH variable. The line below could be added to your .bashrc file so the path is available in each started shell/terminal

export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

Download Yocto recipes

The Yocto project consists of many recipes used when building an image. These recipes come from several repositories and the repo tool is used to download these repositories.

In step 3 below a branch must be selected of the influx-yocto-base repository. This table lists the available branches.
Branch name     Description
influx-5.15.32  u-boot: 2022.04. Linux: 5.15.32
influx-5.15.5   u-boot: 2022.04. Linux: 5.15.5
influx-5.10.72  u-boot: 2021.04. Linux: 5.10.72
influx-5.10.35  u-boot: 2021.04. Linux: 5.10.35

    Create a directory for the downloaded files (influx-bsp in the example below)

mkdir influx-bsp
cd influx-bsp

    Configure Git if you havenâ€™t already done so. Change "Your name" to your actual name and "Your e-mail" to your e-mail address.

git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "Your e-mail"

    Initialize repo. The file containing all needed repositories is downloaded in this step. Change <selected branch> to a branch name according to the table above.

repo init -u https://github.com/InfluxTechnology/influx-yocto-base -b <selected branch>

    Start to download files

repo sync

All files have now been downloaded into the influx-bsp directory. Most of the files will actually be available in the sub-directory called sources.
